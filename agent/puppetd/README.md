The plugin has been superseded by a new Puppet agent: [https://github.com/puppetlabs/mcollective-puppet-agent](https://github.com/puppetlabs/mcollective-puppet-agent) and is available as packages from apt.puppetlabs.com and yum.puppetlabs.com as mcollective-puppet-agent

This version will stay up here till a new Puppet Commander has been written and then it will be removed.
